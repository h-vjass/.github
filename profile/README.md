ðŸš€ h-vJass running on windows platform, is a technical framework. It combines the YDWE runtime environment, in the original
jass runtime to add the
framework of the author's philosophy, making the production of Warcraft 3 maps more convenient and efficient. At that
time, the vast majority of authors are still using the T trigger to do the map, it is brave to break through the times.

ðŸŒˆ Using this framework , you can cover up all kinds of strange problems in the native environment , including the null
leak problem , if you use jass to make maps , we recommend that you refer to this framework.
